        <p>I recently visited Tadoba and saw Maya, the famous tigress. It was an unforgettable experience!</p>
        <p>Sighting Maya: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Experience and the Journey to a Stamp Ticket Release.As a wildlife photographer and an honorary wildlife warden, my journey has been filled with unforgettable encounters with nature’s most magnificent creatures. But among them, one experience stands out—the day I sighted Maya, the legendary tigress of Tadoba. This sighting not only deepened my passion for wildlife photography but also led to an incredible achievement: the release of an Indian postage stamp featuring Maya.
           The Sighting of Maya: A Moment of Pure Magic
           Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve, often referred to as the “Jewel of Vidarbha,” is home to some of India’s most famous tigers. Among them, Maya stands as an undisputed queen. With her striking appearance and dominant presence, she has captivated wildlife enthusiasts and photographers for years.
           One early morning, I set out on a safari with my camera, hoping to catch a glimpse of Tadoba’s elusive predators. The jungle was alive with sounds—the calls of birds, the rustling of leaves, and the distant alarm calls of langurs and spotted deer, signaling the presence of a big cat. The anticipation was electrifying.
           As we moved deeper into the forest, the gypsy suddenly came to a halt. The guide pointed towards a dry riverbed, whispering, “Maya!” And there she was—graceful yet powerful, her amber eyes scanning the surroundings. She walked with an effortless elegance, completely unfazed by our presence. The golden morning light perfectly illuminated her majestic frame, creating a scene that felt surreal.
           I raised my camera, my hands steady yet my heart racing. Click after click, I captured Maya in her natural habitat—walking through the dry grass, pausing to listen, and then melting into the wilderness. The experience was brief, but the impact was everlasting. It was not just a sighting; it was a privilege.
           The Journey to a Stamp Release
           Wildlife photography is not just about capturing moments; it’s about storytelling and conservation. My photographs of Maya gained attention, and I felt the need to use them for a larger purpose—to celebrate Tadoba’s biodiversity and raise awareness about tiger conservation.
           The idea of featuring Maya on an Indian postage stamp was ambitious, but with persistence, it became a reality. After discussions with the postal authorities and showcasing Maya’s significance in the wildlife tourism landscape, the proposal was approved. The official release of the Maya stamp was a moment of immense pride—not just for me but for every wildlife lover who has followed her journey.
           Standing at the stamp unveiling event, holding the first-day cover featuring Maya, was surreal. It was more than just a photograph turned into a stamp; it was a tribute to one of India’s most iconic tigers.
           A Legacy in the Wild
           Maya continues to rule Tadoba, inspiring countless photographers, tourists, and conservationists. For me, that one sighting changed everything—it solidified my love for wildlife photography, reinforced my commitment to conservation, and led to a milestone that will remain etched in history.
           The jungle always has surprises in store, but my encounter with Maya remains the most special. And now, through the stamp, she continues to live on, not just in the wild but also in the hands of people across India.<p>

        <p>
            During one of my night safaris, I encountered a leopard only a few meters away. 
            The sudden eye contact was both thrilling and terrifying. Read on to relive the moment!

        <h2>The Leopard’s Gaze</h2>
        <p>
            The forest was silent, except for the distant alarm calls of deer. Suddenly, I spotted 
            a pair of glowing eyes staring right at me. The leopard was camouflaged within the shadows, 
            perfectly blending with the surroundings. For a brief moment, time stood still.
        </p>

        <h2>What Happened Next?</h2>
        <p>
            Instead of running away, the leopard maintained eye contact, observing my every move. 
            I slowly backed away, keeping my composure. Within seconds, the magnificent predator 
            vanished into the dense foliage. It was a heart-stopping experience that I will never forget!

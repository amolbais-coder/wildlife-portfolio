          <p>Maya, the legendary tigress of Tadoba, carries a bloodline of strength and grace. She is the daughter of Leela, who herself was born to the great tigress Catrina. Ruling the Pandharpauni area, Maya established herself as an icon of Tadoba's wilderness.</p>
          
          <p>It was a crisp January morning in 2016, during a safari in Tadoba. Scanning the Tadoba lake, I noticed older pug marks leading towards Pandharpauni junction. As I reached, there she was—Maya—sitting in the middle of the road, her eyes focused, her body language hinting at a possible stalk. A herd of deer sensed her presence and, with alarm calls, scattered into the forest. Realizing the hunt was lost, she relaxed.</p>
          
          <p>Vehicles and tourists surrounded her, cameras clicking non-stop. I chose to move away, repositioning myself, not wanting the chaos in my frame. I had a feeling—her cubs were nearby. Time passed, and then, she growled—a deep, commanding call. And from the bushes, a tiny cub emerged, rushing to her mother.</p>
          
          <p>What followed was pure magic. The cub cuddled into Maya, seeking warmth and affection. She licked it, grooming with care. Then, in an incredible moment, the cub stood on its hind legs and hugged its mother. It was a moment of eternal love—a bond beyond words. I captured a series of photographs, but one stood apart. The cub, looking directly at me, embracing its mother—it was more than a picture. It was a story.</p>
          
          <p>That single shot changed my photographic journey. It found its way onto an Indian Postal Stamp, reaching people across the nation. Later, it was featured on metro trains, making history. Maya holds a special place in my heart, not just as a tiger but as a mother, a queen, and a legend of the wild.</p>

        <article class="article-content">
            <p><strong>Maya</strong>, the legendary tigress of Tadoba, carries a bloodline of strength and grace. She is the daughter of <strong>Leela</strong>, who herself was born to the great tigress <strong>Catrina</strong>. Ruling the <em>Pandharpauni</em> area, Maya established herself as an icon of Tadoba's wilderness.</p>
            
            <p>It was a crisp January morning in <strong>2016</strong>, during a safari in Tadoba. Scanning the Tadoba lake, I noticed older pug marks leading towards <em>Pandharpauni junction</em>. As I reached, there she wasâ€”<strong>Maya</strong>â€”sitting in the middle of the road, her eyes focused, her body language hinting at a possible stalk.</p>
            
            <p>A herd of deer sensed her presence and, with alarm calls, scattered into the forest. Realizing the hunt was lost, she relaxed. Vehicles and tourists surrounded her, cameras clicking non-stop. I chose to move away, repositioning myself, not wanting the chaos in my frame.</p>

            <blockquote class="highlight">"I had a feelingâ€”her cubs were nearby. Time passed, and then, she growledâ€”a deep, commanding call. And from the bushes, a tiny cub emerged, rushing to her mother."</blockquote>

            <p>What followed was <strong>pure magic</strong>. The cub cuddled into Maya, seeking warmth and affection. She licked it, grooming with care. Then, in an <em>incredible moment</em>, the cub stood on its hind legs and hugged its mother. It was a moment of eternal loveâ€”a bond beyond words.</p>
            
            <p>I captured a series of photographs, but one stood apart. The cub, looking directly at me, embracing its motherâ€”it was more than a picture. It was a <strong>story</strong>.</p>

            <p>That single shot changed my photographic journey. It found its way onto an <strong>Indian Postal Stamp</strong>, reaching people across the nation. Later, it was featured on <strong>metro trains</strong>, making history.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Maya</strong> holds a special place in my heart, not just as a tiger but as a mother, a queen, and a legend of the wild.</p>

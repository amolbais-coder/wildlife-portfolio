        <h1>Winter Birding in Gujarat: A Solo Journey</h1>
        <h2>Exploring the coastal and inland birding hotspots of Gujarat with a Nikon mirrorless, witnessing the impact of climate change on migratory patterns, and embracing the art of patience in wildlife photography.</h2>
        
        <p>Winter in Gujarat has always held a special charm for birdwatchers. As 2025 unfolded, I found myself in Porbandar, ready to explore the coastal wonders of Jamnagar—one of the finest destinations for spotting migratory birds along India’s western coastline. This time, I was traveling solo, armed with my new Nikon mirrorless camera paired with a 600mm telephoto lens, a perfect setup for capturing distant subjects with incredible detail.</p>

        <p>Jamnagar’s coastline is a paradise for birders. The usual winter visitors, such as Greater Flamingos, Lesser Flamingos, Eurasian Oystercatchers, Bar-tailed Godwits, Curlews, and Ruddy Turnstones, grace the muddy shores and salt pans. However, this year, I noticed a subtle shift—migration patterns were altered by global warming. Birds that would typically arrive in large numbers seemed sporadic, with delayed appearances and smaller flocks. The warming Arctic and changing monsoon patterns have undoubtedly begun to reshape the birding landscape.</p>

        <p>After spending time along the coast, I moved inland. A short journey brought me to Kuchadi, a lesser-known but promising location for spotting Demoiselle Cranes. Though primarily migratory, some of these elegant cranes have been observed overwintering in the fields near Porbandar, possibly due to changing habitat conditions. Their presence in the groundnut fields was a treat. The open fields, golden in the winter sunlight, offered a contrasting backdrop to these graceful birds. Staying low, I began my slow crawl approach, a technique that every serious bird photographer must master. The challenge wasn’t just maintaining patience but also ensuring stability while maneuvering the camera in low light.</p>

        <p>This trip was also an opportunity to test my Nikon mirrorless setup with a 600mm telephoto lens. The silent shooting mode eliminated shutter noise, allowing for discreet photography, which was crucial when getting close to skittish birds like the Common Greenshank. The fast autofocus made tracking birds in flight effortless, especially fast-moving Terns. Low-light performance was impressive, handling the soft winter mist beautifully while preserving feather details even in backlit conditions. The electronic viewfinder advantage helped in adjusting settings instantly rather than relying on trial and error, making every shot more intentional.</p>

        <p>After wrapping up in Kuchadi, I took a local bus to Jamnagar, then hired a Chhakda, a modified three-wheeler, the best way to scan roadside fields for raptors and other wintering species. Over the past few years, I’ve explored Gujarat’s birding gems, and each visit brings new lessons. Lakhota Lake in Jamnagar remains a fantastic place to see gulls, terns, and waders up close, with early mornings offering dreamy reflections and golden-hour light enhancing the colors of birds like the Pallas’s Gull. Khijadiya Bird Sanctuary, with its blend of freshwater and saltwater wetlands, attracts a rich mix of ducks, geese, and shorebirds, with the elusive Black-necked Stork being a highlight. Thol Lake, near Ahmedabad, is best for large congregations of Pelicans, Spoonbills, and Painted Storks. I found it an excellent testing ground for high-speed burst photography, capturing the chaotic yet mesmerizing take-offs of Sarus Cranes.</p>

        <p>Kutch, however, remains the ultimate winter birding destination. From the famous Great Rann to the wetlands of Chari Dhandh, it offers an unparalleled variety of avian life. Steppe Eagles winter here in large numbers, Indian Coursers blend perfectly with the dry scrub, and the mesmerizing flight of Rosy Starlings is always a sight to behold. Spending winters in Gujarat is a must for any serious birder or photographer. The variety of species, combined with the diverse landscapes, offers something new on every visit. This trip, like many before, was a masterclass in patience, observation, and adaptation, not just in birding but also in understanding how nature is evolving in response to climate change. And as I wrapped up my journey, packing away my Nikon mirrorless and 600mm lens, I knew one thing for sure—there’s always another winter, another birding story waiting to be captured.</p>
